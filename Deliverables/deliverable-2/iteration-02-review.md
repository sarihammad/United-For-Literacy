# **Iteration 2 Review**

## **Discuss your team’s performance and process changes**

**What Worked Well**

Our team did well to merge our individual contributions from the previous assignment together in order to create this deliverable as an improved continuation of the project. We also did a good job to split up the work and ensure that everyone was working on something that they were familiar with or were interested in from the previous assignment. Each member was given the freedom to attempt new things if they wanted to. This worked out well since everyone was doing something that they either wanted to work on or were motivated to achieve/learn. Furthermore, it was made a priority to have consistent communication within the group and with our partner, United For Literacy. This helped manage expectations and ensure our progress forward was well laid out. Lastly, our partner was satisfied with the features that were implemented and the direction we are taking the project in. We were able to complete many of the objectives and goals we had established for this deliverable.

**What Didn’t Work Well**

While we collectively agree that the overall performance of the team was positive, there were some challenges that we experienced that hindered our ability to implement some of the features we had initially planned on including for this deliverable. The main problem we faced was implementing a comprehensive login system that can distinguish between a volunteer, an employee/staff member, and an administrator. Depending on which of the three options a user logs in as, certain features, information, and documentation are accessible. We struggled due to our lack of experience in developing something like this, leading us to spend a lot of time learning and researching. However, we plan to tackle this issue for the next deliverable as it is something that the client had requested as one of the main features to develop.

## **How will you plan to continue working together**
We will continue to plan our tasks ahead of time so that we know what features are being worked on. These tasks will be split up amongst the team so that everyone can contribute to the project in some way. Additionally, the team will continue to keep a steady stream of communication between every member and the partner as well so that we can make sure that their needs are being met and the project is continuing in a direction that they want. Further meetings will be held with the partner and changes to the project will be made in accordance to the feedback and requests that we receive from United For Literacy.

## **Analyze or report on the demo to your partner and their feedback**
In our last partner meeting, we showed the demo of our application with the latest updates to various employees and executives to which they approved of the progress. These updates included a chat system, hour tracking, the ability to access resources and information straight from United For Literacy's Salesforce database, and more. Notably, they were extremely happy with the updated design of the user interface. Furthermore, the implemented features such as the messaging system and volunteer hour tracking system were aligned with their expectations and desires. Overall, the partner was very satisfied with the team's progress.
